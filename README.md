Thymynd - Making Quality Decision, for one and all.

A mobile responsive website built from scratch for the my friend's project. It was hosted on hostinger hosting platform for one year, with the url https://thymynd.website
Now discontinued.

Built and designed from scratch by David Choy, content designed by Monique Ho.
It is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and some SQL commands to manage the MySQL database.
It has been changed from a dynamic site to a static site in order to host it for free on GitHub.
