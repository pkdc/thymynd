Thymynd - Making Quality Decision, for one and all.

A mobile responsive website built from scratch for the my friend's project. It was hosted on hostinger hosting platform for one year but now discontinued. It is currently hosting on https://pkdc.github.io/thymynd/

Built and designed from scratch by me, content designed by my friend Monique Ho.
It was written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and some SQL commands to manage the MySQL database.
Now there is only the frontend, and the MySQL database is disconnected.
