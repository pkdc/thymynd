Thymynd - Making Quality Decision, for one and all.

A mobile responsive website which was hosted on hostinger hosting platform. It is currently hosting on GitHub Pages: https://pkdc.github.io/thymynd/

It was written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and some SQL commands to manage the MySQL database.
Now there is only the frontend, and the MySQL database is disconnected.
