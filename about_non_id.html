    <strong>ThyMynd<br>
    Noun | /ðʌɪ . mʌɪnd/ | pronounced as Thy-mind</strong><br>
    We played with the words ‘Your Mind’, but ultimately Thymynd is about facilitating you for quality decision making.

     The friends met at the College X years ago and have been in touch for badminton, food, travel (and a long list of random stuff) since then.<br>
   One day, they deep-dived in the observations of personal resilience and mental health support at school levels. The discussion resonated with them so much that, they want to make Thymynd work for one and for all.
